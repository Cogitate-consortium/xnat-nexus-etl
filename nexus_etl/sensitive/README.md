# Steps

## File Creation
1. copy nexus_token to nexus_token.txt
2. copy xnat_config to xnat_config.cfg

## Complete nexus_token.txt
Copy your token from the Blue Brain Nexus UI and paste into this file.  Remember that, unless you have configured a non-expiring token for Nexus, you will likely need to copy and update the token in this file when the token expires.
