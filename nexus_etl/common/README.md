# common

These are a set of scripts and objects that can be used by multiple systems that load to the data warehouse.

The config folder contains a file named 'env_config.yml'.  That is the only file that contains variables specific to the environment that the scripts are deployed in (local laptop, research server, clinical server, etc.).

The other files in common should be independent of the environment.
